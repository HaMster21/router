# Router

A little library that implements a [Kademlia](http://www.maymounkov.org/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) distributed hash-table. It's written in functional-style C++14. It is intended to work as a foundation for distributed scalable games on various platforms, focusing primarily on Linux.

## :see_no_evil: How is the project

Builds are triggered from GitHub. Linux binaries are built on [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), Windows Builds are done on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects). Where no current support for C++14 is available, [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) is the compiler of choice. All platforms make use of the latest [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) available to configure the build.
